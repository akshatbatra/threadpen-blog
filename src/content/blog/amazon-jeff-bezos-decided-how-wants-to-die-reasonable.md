Jeff Bezos appeared on Lex Fridman's podcast #405 where he shared insights about his childhood spent on a Texas ranch, his passion for space exploration and the engineering behind Blue Origin’s (his space rocket company) cutting-edge technologies. Bezos also reflected on Amazon’s growth, his approach to work, life, and the future of humanity. He emphasized the importance of principles and productivity in shaping both his personal life and his business ventures.

At the end of the podcast he also opened up on a subject that people often tend to avoid thinking too much about. In a world where the fear of mortality often looms large, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has a surprisingly pragmatic view on the subject of death. In conversation with Lex Fridman, Bezos opened up about his perspective on life, death, and what he hopes for his own end.

Fridman asked him- "On that grand scale, a human life feels tiny. Do you ponder your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?".

Bezos, now 59, admitted that he used to be afraid of death. As a young person, the thought of mortality terrified him. However, as he has grown older, that fear has gradually faded. Instead of focusing on the inevitability of death, Bezos has shifted his focus to the quality of life. He expressed a desire for a “health span” - a life that is not just long, but also healthy.

“I want that square wave. I want to be healthy, healthy, healthy, and then gone. I don’t want the long decay,” Bezos said. This statement reveals a lot about Bezos’ philosophy towards life and death. He values health and vitality over longevity, preferring a sudden end to a prolonged period of decline.

But it’s not just about health for Bezos. He also spoke about his curiosity and his desire to see how things turn out. He mentioned his love for his family and close friends, and his interest in their lives. These relationships and his natural curiosity are what keep him wanting to stay around.

This perspective on death is not just reasonable, but also quite refreshing. In a society that often shies away from discussions about mortality, Bezos’ candidness is a breath of fresh air. Jeff’s perspective on health and mortality is rooted in the concept of maximizing one’s “healthspan” rather than lifespan. Bezos’ approach reflects a positive attitude towards life and death, which can contribute to overall psychological well-being. He expresses more curiosity than anxiety about the future, indicating a healthy acceptance of life’s impermanence. Jeff's decision of focusing on his healthspan and dying like Thanos just snapped his fingers is pretty thought provoking.

It's reasonable as Bezos’ view promotes the idea of living life to its fullest, maintaining good health, and embracing the inevitability of death when it comes, thereby maximizing both the quality and enjoyment of life. In the end, Bezos’ views on death reflect his approach to life - pragmatic, forward-thinking, and unafraid of challenging conventions. As he continues to shape the future with his ventures in technology and space exploration, it’s clear that Bezos is someone who isn’t just planning for life, but also for a dignified and peaceful end.
